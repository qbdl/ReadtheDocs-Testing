    :alt: Documentation Status

.. This README.rst should work on Github and is also included in the Sphinx documentation project in docs/ - therefore, README.rst uses absolute links for most things so it renders properly on GitHub
📚 `docs/ <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/>`_
    A basic Sphinx project lives in ``docs/``. All the ``*.rst`` make up sections in the documentation.
⚙️ `.readthedocs.yaml <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/.readthedocs.yaml>`_
    Read the Docs Build configuration is stored in ``.readthedocs.yaml``.
⚙️ `docs/conf.py <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/conf.py>`_
    Both the configuration and the folder layout follow Sphinx default conventions. You can change the `Sphinx configuration values <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html>`_ in this file
📍 `docs/requirements.txt <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt>`_ and `docs/requirements.in <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.in>`_
    Python dependencies are `pinned <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/reproducible-builds.html>`_ (uses `pip-tools <https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_). Make sure to add your Python dependencies to ``requirements.txt`` or if you choose `pip-tools <https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, edit ``docs/requirements.in`` and remember to run ``pip-compile docs/requirements.in``.
💡 `docs/api.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/api.rst>`_
    By adding our example Python module ``lumache`` in the reStructuredText directive ``:autosummary:``, Sphinx will automatically scan this module and generate API docs.
💡 `docs/usage.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/usage.rst>`_
    Sphinx can automatically extract API documentation directly from Python modules, using for instance the ``:autofunction:`` directive.
💡 `lumache.py <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/lumache.py>`_
    API docs are generated for this example Python module - they use *docstrings* directly in the documentation, notice how this shows up in the rendered documentation.
🔢 Git tags versioning
    We use a basic versioning mechanism by adding a git tag for every release of the example project. All releases and their version numbers are visible on `example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io <https://example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
📜 `README.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/README.rst>`_
    Contents of this ``README.rst`` are visible on Github and included on `the documentation index page <https://example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (Don't Repeat Yourself).
